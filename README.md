# Computer Components Form

One-pager prototype of an order form for computer components using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the Bootstrap framework integrated to enhance the design. 

## Functionalities
Users can select a product from a dropdown menu, specify the quantity (1 to 5), and see the price update in real time. The total price adjusts dynamically with each change. Users also have the option to remove products from their shopping cart. Additionally, a user information form is provided. 

Finally, in an actual deployment, the “send” button would send the sell details to the provider for processing the order (this functionality is not implemented here, as there is currently no endpoint to receive and process the order).
